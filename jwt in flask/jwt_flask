JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are very popular nowadays.
Modern web-development is target at building Single Page Applications by using latest JavaScript libraries such as:-
  Angular, React or Vue. 
Because of that reason, JWT becomes a standard of authorization and communication between SPAs and web servers.
I want to build a Flask web server with JWT authorization.

Let’s start with setting up Flask

$ mkdir jwt
$ cd flask-jwt
$ virtualenv -p python3 venv

# following command will activate virtual environment on macOs/Linux
$ source venv/bin/activate

After activation of virtual environment install following packages:

(venv) pip install flask flask-restful flask-jwt-extended passlib flask-sqlalchemy

Here we have:

Flask-RESTful — to create API endpoints
Flask-JWT-Extended — to generate and check JWT
passlib — to generate secure password hashes
Flask-SQLAlchemy — Object-relational mapping to database

flask-jwt
├── views.py     # views of the server
├── models.py    # database models
├── resources.py # API endpoints
└── run.py       # main script to start the server
